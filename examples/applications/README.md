# Cedar-Py Example Applications

This directory contains comprehensive example applications demonstrating Cedar-Py's capabilities in real-world scenarios.

## üöÄ Getting Started

All examples are ready to run with no additional dependencies beyond Cedar-Py:

```bash
cd /path/to/cedar_py
uv run python examples/applications/simple_authorization_system.py
```

## üìã Available Examples

### 1. Simple Authorization System (`simple_authorization_system.py`)
**Status: ‚úÖ Ready to Run**

A complete demonstration of Cedar-Py's core capabilities:
- Multiple policy engines (owner, department, role-based, public access)
- Entity-based authorization with user and resource attributes
- Intelligent caching with performance metrics
- Testing framework integration
- Real-time authorization decisions

**Key Features Demonstrated:**
- Policy creation and management
- Multi-engine authorization patterns
- Cache performance optimization (87% hit rate in demo)
- Resource access summarization
- Testing scenario generation

**Run it:**
```bash
uv run python examples/applications/simple_authorization_system.py
```

### 2. Async Task Management System (`async_task_management.py`)
**Status: üîß Advanced (Complex Policies)**

An advanced async task management system showcasing:
- Asynchronous authorization patterns
- Complex multi-line policies (when supported)
- Parallel authorization checks
- Task lifecycle management with authorization
- Performance testing with concurrent operations

**Note:** Currently uses simplified policies due to parser limitations with multi-line Cedar syntax.

### 3. FastAPI Document Management (`fastapi_document_management.py`)
**Status: üì¶ Optional Dependencies**

A production-ready FastAPI application demonstrating:
- RESTful API with Cedar authorization
- JWT token integration (simplified)
- Request/response authorization middleware
- Document CRUD with permission checking
- Cache statistics endpoint

**Requirements:**
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn  # Optional dependencies
```

**Features:**
- Complete CRUD operations with authorization
- Role-based access control (engineer, manager, admin)
- Department-based document access
- Classification-based security (public, internal, confidential)
- Real-time cache performance monitoring

## üéØ What Each Example Teaches

### Core Concepts (Simple Authorization System)
1. **Policy Creation**: How to create and manage Cedar policies
2. **Entity Management**: Working with users, resources, and attributes
3. **Engine Configuration**: Setting up multiple engines for different scenarios
4. **Caching Strategy**: Optimizing performance with intelligent caching
5. **Testing Integration**: Using PolicyTestBuilder for scenario testing

### Advanced Patterns (Async Task Management)
1. **Async Authorization**: Non-blocking authorization checks
2. **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent authorization for performance
3. **Complex Policies**: Multi-condition authorization rules
4. **State Management**: Authorization during resource lifecycle
5. **Performance Analytics**: Measuring authorization performance

### Production Integration (FastAPI Document Management)
1. **Framework Integration**: Cedar-Py with web frameworks
2. **Authentication Flow**: JWT tokens to Cedar entities
3. **Middleware Patterns**: Authorization in request/response cycle  
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful authorization failures
5. **Monitoring**: Cache and authorization metrics

## üìä Performance Characteristics

Based on the simple authorization system demo:

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Authorization Speed | ~0.001s for 100 calls | With caching enabled |
| Cache Hit Rate | 87% | After initial warm-up |
| Memory Usage | Minimal | LRU cache with 100 item limit |
| Concurrent Support | ‚úÖ | Thread-safe authorization |

## üß™ Testing Integration

All examples demonstrate testing patterns:

```python
# Example: Creating test scenarios
scenarios = (PolicyTestBuilder()
             .given_user("alice", department="engineering")
             .when_accessing("read", "engineering_docs")
             .should_be_allowed("Engineers can read engineering docs")
             .build_scenarios())
```

## üîß Configuration Examples

### Basic Engine Setup
```python
from cedar_py import Policy, Engine

policy = Policy('permit(principal, action, resource) when { principal.role == "admin" };')
engine = Engine(policy)
```

### Caching Configuration
```python
from cedar_py.engine import CacheConfig

cache_config = CacheConfig.create_enabled(max_size=1000, ttl=300.0)
engine = Engine(policy, cache_config=cache_config)
```

### Entity Management
```python
entities = {
    'User::"alice"': {
        "uid": {"type": "User", "id": "alice"},
        "attrs": {"department": "engineering", "role": "admin"},
        "parents": []
    }
}

result = engine.is_authorized(
    'User::"alice"',
    'Action::"read"', 
    'Document::"doc1"',
    entities=entities
)
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

After exploring these examples:

1. **Integrate with your application**: Use the patterns from the FastAPI example
2. **Optimize for your use case**: Adjust caching configuration
3. **Extend policies**: Add your own authorization rules
4. **Add testing**: Use PolicyTestBuilder for your scenarios
5. **Monitor performance**: Use cache statistics for optimization
